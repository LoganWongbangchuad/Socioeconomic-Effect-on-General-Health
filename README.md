Socioeconomic factors such as employment status, income, education level, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender influence overall health outcomes. This paper aims to study how each socioeconomic factor has an effect on general health. We will use exploratory data analysis techniques, such as multiple correspondence analysis, to determine which socioeconomic factors affect general health the most drastically. Through this research paper, we will be able to classify when someone will have poor health based on socioeconomic status (SES) and determine if physical activity helps mitigate low SES. The data set used to conduct this study is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is a national survey administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2023. To support the claim that SES affects general health, Machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, trees, and ensemble models, such as boosting, bagging, and stacking will be used.
